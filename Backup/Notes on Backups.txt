mainFunction-5.R 
is a good working stable version of the script. It can be used for processing CO2, RH, and O2 data
It was used for most data processed in March 2016. 
Data processed before that data would have been processed with similar code, though not exactly the same. The code was always evolving.
This is a snapshot of the code, kept as backup for traceability. i.e. incase any problems are found, or processed data is deleted and needs to be re-processed in the same way.
This version is being backed up because the code is about to be purged of unnecessary lines, comments, etc.
New features will be implemented after the purging.
This code is being saved for traceability in case any of the changes alter the behaviour of the script.

mainFunction.R 
is the same or pretty similar to the original code provided by Marvin Lav.

mainFunction-2.R and above, until mainFunction-5.R
are itterations on the way to mainFunction-5.R
